# ChatGPT-like Website
## In Development and Bug Fixes
This project is a proof of concept of a website that uses ChatGPT technology to generate responses based on user queries. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI capable of understanding and generating text coherently.

This project is currently in active development, and I am continuously working to improve its functionality and user experience. Please be aware that there may be bugs and errors present as we refine the code and add new features.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create an issue in the repository. Your feedback is valuable to me as I strive to make this project better.

Thank you for your understanding and support as I continue to enhance the ChatGPT-like website.
